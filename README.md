## Overview

LOKI (Library of Knowledge Integration) is a bioinformatics data integration platform designed to aggregate and manage data from various genomic, genetic, and biological databases. It serves as a local repository that can be used to quickly access structured biological knowledge for downstream analysis, such as filtering, annotating, and modeling gene-gene or SNP-SNP interactions. 

By working with local data instead of issuing real-time queries to external databases, LOKI enables faster and more flexible data processing, improving efficiency in bioinformatic pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Data Integration**: Merges data from multiple external sources into a unified local database.
- **Flexible Data Queries**: Supports querying different data types like SNPs, genes, proteins, pathways, and ontological categories.
- **Annotation and Filtering**: Facilitates the annotation of data sets with biological context and filtering based on genomic criteria.
- **Interaction Modeling**: Allows for gene-gene and SNP-SNP interaction modeling to reduce computational burden and enhance statistical analysis.
- **No Internet Dependency**: Works offline by using a pre-built local database.

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **SQLite3** (or another supported database)
- **Git**

### Installing via PyPI

To install LOKI via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/loki):

```bash
pip install loki
```

### Installing from Source

Alternatively, clone the repository and install the dependencies manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loki.git
cd loki
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up the Database

LOKI requires the creation of a local database that aggregates external biological data sources. You can generate the database with the following command:

```bash
python loki_db.py --build
```

This process may take some time depending on the amount of data being imported.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

1. **Database Querying**: To query the LOKI database for SNPs related to a specific gene:

```bash
python loki_query.py --gene A1BG
```

2. **Filtering SNP Data**: You can filter a dataset by genomic location or gene association:

```bash
python loki_filter.py --input mydata.txt --filter genes --output filtered_data.txt
```

3. **Interaction Modeling**: For generating SNP-SNP interaction models:

```bash
python loki_model.py --input snps.txt --model snp-snp --output models.txt
```

### Configuration

You can configure LOKI using a `config.yaml` file located in the project root. This file contains settings for database paths, default filters, and other preferences.
